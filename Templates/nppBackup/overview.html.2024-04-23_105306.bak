<div class="scam-section">
    <h3>Recognizing Landline Nuisance Calls</h3>
    <p>Landline nuisance callers often use various tactics to deceive you. Knowing these can help you protect your personal information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Request for Personal Information:</strong> Callers asking for your name, Date of Birth (D.O.B), or address could be attempting voice phishing.</li>
        <li><strong>Impatience and Demand:</strong> A caller who is being impatient and demanding is likely trying to pressure you into giving away sensitive information.</li>
        <li><strong>Robotic Voice:</strong> Calls that sound like they're from a robot might be automated and pre-recorded, used by scammers to reach more potential victims.</li>
        <li><strong>Request for Bank Details:</strong> No legitimate company will ask for your bank details over the phone. This is a clear red flag.</li>
    </ul>
