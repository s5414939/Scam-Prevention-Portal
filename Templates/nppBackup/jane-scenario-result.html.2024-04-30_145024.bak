        <p>Jane was able to verify the end of your contract date and the last 4 digits of your banking card this heightens her legitimacy.</p>

        <p>You are aware of all your current subscriptions and were expecting a call from the company.</p>
        <p>You have verified her phone number and it matches the contact details of a legitimate phone company.</p>
        <p>She did not ask for bank details, legitimate companies never ask for bank details over the phone.</p>
