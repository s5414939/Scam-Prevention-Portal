        <p>If you receive a call from a company that you haven't contacted, do some research before providing any personal or financial information.</p>
        <p>Check the phone number! They have called you before and it's associated with a known scam organisation.</p>
        <p>A genuine salesperson would never ask for personal details such as power of attorney.</p>
        <p>Stay up to date with your subscriptions. This will help you spot scammers and reduce your chances of being fooled.</p>
        <p>Be cautious, personal information alone doesn't guarantee authenticity.</p>
